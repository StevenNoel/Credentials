# Create-Automate-Credentials
This script is used to store encrypted credentials.  These files can be used to make calls from other scripts as a way to securely call credentials.  AKA, run a scheduled script, and inside the script use the credentials that were used to create the files.

NOTE:  Make sure you lock down the files that get created.  You can do this via NTFS security.
